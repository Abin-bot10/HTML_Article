  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It's the foundation of the World Wide Web and has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 1990s. Here's a brief overview of its history:</p>

  <h3>1. Birth of HTML (1989-1991):</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), in 1989.</li>
    <li>The initial idea was to facilitate the sharing of documents among researchers.</li>
    <li>The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was published in 1991. It included basic formatting tags such as <strong>h1</strong> for headers and <strong>p</strong>for paragraphs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Standardization (1995-1997):</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML began to gain popularity rapidly with the growth of the internet.</li>
    <li>In 1995, HTML 2.0 was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</li>
    <li>This version introduced features like tables and forms, expanding the capabilities of web pages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Rise of Web Standards (1997-1999):</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 to develop common protocols for the evolution of the web.</li>
    <li>HTML 3.2 was released in 1997, introducing support for features like tables, applets, and text flow around images.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. XHTML and HTML4 (1999-2000):</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML 4.01, released in 1999, standardized many new features like scripting languages (JavaScript), style sheets (CSS), and multimedia (like audio and video).</li>
    <li>Around the same time, XHTML (Extensible HTML) was developed, which followed the rules of XML (eXtensible Markup Language). XHTML aimed to make HTML more compatible with other XML-based technologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. HTML5 (2008-2014):</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML5 development started in 2004 with the goal of improving the language with support for multimedia while being backward-compatible.</li>
    <li>It introduced new features such as <strong>canvas</strong>  for drawing graphics, <strong>video</strong> and <strong>audio</strong> for media playback, <strong>svg</strong>for vector graphics, and <strong>input</strong>  types for better forms.</li>
    <li>HTML5 was finalized in 2014, bringing new semantic elements like <strong> article</strong>, <strong>section</strong>, and <strong>nav</strong>, which enhanced accessibility and SEO.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Modern HTML (2014-Present):</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML continues to evolve under the guidance of the W3C</li>
    <li>New features and APIs are added to improve functionality and performance, including support for responsive design, web components, and APIs for geolocation, offline web apps, and more.</li>
    <li>HTML remains the cornerstone of web development, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
  </ul><hr>

  <h5 style="text-align: center;">Throughout its history, HTML has undergone significant updates to meet the changing demands of web development and user experience, from simple text markup to a versatile language capable of powering complex web applications and multimedia-rich websites.</h5>
